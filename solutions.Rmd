```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

## Load initial data 

Our initial step is to load the data from our csv.
We started by cleaning up the excel file and created two csv containing:
- previous website visits history
- yahoo's forecast leading to 1.2Bn valuation

In order to a single environment we will directly compute the NPV from R in order to avoid having to export the data to excel.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
